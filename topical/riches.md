# Riches

## Principles
### Labor for Zion, not for money
[2 Nephi 26:31](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.31)  
31 But the laborer in Zion shall labor for Zion; for if they labor for money they shall perish.  

### Be generous
[Jacob 2:17-19](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.17-19?lang=eng#p16)  
17 Think of your brethren like unto yourselves, and ***be familiar with all and free with your substance***, that they may be rich like unto you.  
18 But ***before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of God.***  
19 And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to do good—to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted.  

[D&C 52:40](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/52.40?lang=eng#p39)  
40 And remember in all things the poor and the needy, the sick and the afflicted, for he that doeth not these things, the same is not my disciple.  

[Mosiah 16:19](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.16-19)  
16 And also, ye yourselves will succor those that stand in need of your succor; ye will administer of your substance unto him that standeth in need; and ye will not suffer that the beggar putteth up his petition to you in vain, and turn him out to perish.  
17 Perhaps thou shalt say: The man has brought upon himself his misery; therefore I will stay my hand, and will not give unto him of my food, nor impart unto him of my substance that he may not suffer, for his punishments are just—  
18 But I say unto you, O man, whosoever doeth this the same hath great cause to repent; and except he repenteth of that which he hath done he perisheth forever, and hath no interest in the kingdom of God.  
19 For behold, are we not all beggars? Do we not all depend upon the same Being, even God, for all the substance which we have, for both food and raiment, and for gold, and for silver, and for all the riches which we have of every kind?
