## Definition

## Principles
### You're not a child (follower) of God unless you love others
[1 John 3:10-11](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-jn/3.10-11)  
10 In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: ***whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.***  
11 For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.  
### If you have not charity, you are nothing
[2 Nephi 26:30](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.30)  
30 Behold, the Lord hath forbidden this thing; wherefore, the Lord God hath given a commandment that all men should have charity, which charity is love. And ***except they should have charity they were nothing***. Wherefore, if they should have charity they would not suffer the laborer in Zion to perish.  
### Knowledge without Charity creates pride
[1 Corinthians 8:1](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/8.1?lang=eng#p1)  
1 Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.
