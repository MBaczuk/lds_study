# Time

## Infinite Atonement
He told the Church members that "we finite mortals" will not be able to comprehend the infinite Atonement. [We Can't Comprehend the Capacity of God,

## Time is relative
[Alma 40:8](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/40)  
8 Now whether there is more than one time appointed for men to rise it mattereth not; for all do not die at once, and this mattereth not; all is as one day with God, and time only is measured unto men.

[Moses 1:4-6](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.4-6)  
4 And, behold, thou art my son; wherefore look, and I will show thee the workmanship of mine hands; but not all, for my works are without end, and also my words, for they never cease.  
5 Wherefore, no man can behold all my works, except he behold all my glory; and no man can behold all my glory, and afterwards remain in the flesh on the earth.  
6 And I have a work for thee, Moses, my son; and thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten; and mine Only Begotten is and shall be the Savior, for he is full of grace and truth; but there is no God beside me, and all things are present with me, for I know them all.
