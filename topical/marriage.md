# Marriage

## Created from the beginning
[Genesis 2:23-24](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/2.23-24?lang=eng#22)  
23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.  
24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.  

## We are meant to be married
[1 Corinthians 1:11](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/11.11?lang=eng#10)  
11 Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.  

## Eternal

## Day to Day
Marriage, in its truest sense, is a partnership of equals, with neither exercising dominion over the other, but, rather, with each encouraging and assisting the other in whatever responsibilities and aspirations he or she might have. [ 16. “I Believe,” Ensign, Aug. 1992, 6.]

## New and Everlasting Covenant
[D&C 132:18-19](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.18-19?lang=eng#17)
18 And again, verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife, and make a covenant with her for time and for all eternity, if that covenant is not by me or by my word, which is my law, and is not ***sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise***, through him whom I have anointed and appointed unto this power, then it is not valid neither of force when they are out of the world, because they are not joined by me, saith the Lord, neither by my word; when they are out of the world it cannot be received there, because the angels and the gods are appointed there, by whom they cannot pass; they cannot, therefore, ***inherit my glory***; for my house is a house of order, saith the Lord God.  
19 And again, verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife by my word, which is my law, and by the new and everlasting covenant, and it is sealed unto them by the Holy Spirit of promise, by him who is anointed, unto whom I have appointed this power and the keys of this priesthood; and it shall be said unto them—***Ye shall come forth in the first resurrection***; and if it be after the first resurrection, in the next resurrection; and shall ***inherit thrones, kingdoms, principalities, and powers, dominions, all heights and depths***—then shall it be written in the Lamb’s Book of Life, that he shall commit no murder whereby to shed innocent blood, and if ye abide in my covenant, and commit no murder whereby to shed innocent blood, it shall be done unto them in all things whatsoever my servant hath put upon them, in time, and through all eternity; and shall be of full force when they are out of the world; and they shall ***pass by the angels, and the gods, which are set there, to their exaltation and glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon their heads, which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the seeds forever and ever.***
